# Bayesian Vector Autoregressions
- In report.pdf, we give an 8-page theoretical introduction to Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) models with an application to forecasting monetary policy
- In monetaryPolicyExample.Rmd, we built BVAR models with Minnesota & normal-inverse Wishart priors and used a Gibbs sampler to estimate the parameter density functions. Also, we used the model to forecast several macroeconomic variables, which were then used to predict the Federal funds rate using the Taylor rule, which is a benchmark formula used by economists at the Federal Reserve
