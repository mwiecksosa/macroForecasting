- In report.pdf, we give an 8-page theoretical introduction to  Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) models with an application to forecasting the Federal funds rate using the Taylor Rule
- In monetaryPolicyExample.Rmd, we built BVAR models with Minnesota & normal-inverse Wishart priors and used a Gibbs sampler to estimate the parameter density functions. Also, we used model to forecast several macroeconomic variables, which were then used to predict the Federal funds rate using the Taylor Rule
