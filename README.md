- In report.pdf, we give an 8-page theoretical introduction to BVARs with an application to forecasting the Federal funds rate using the Taylor Rule
- In monetaryPolicyExample.Rmd, I built Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVARs) models with Minnesota & normal-inverse Wishart priors and used a Gibbs sampler to estimate the parameter density functions. Also, I used model to forecast several macroeconomic variables, which were then used to predict the Federal funds rate using the Taylor Rule
